# Keepie Uppie Bot (Telegram Game)
[**Keepie Uppie**](http://telegram.me/keepieuppie_bot "Keepie Uppie") is a simple game that I made using HTML5. In order to make it work within the Telegram app, I also created a bot in PHP that allows users to play the game, share it and get and set records.

> DISCLAIMER: There is nothing wrong with the code, but the bot doesn't work anymore because I no longer have a web server up and running.

### The game
The goal of the game is to keep the ball in the air as long as possible by tapping on it.

The design of the game is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

### The bot
The only purpose of the bot is to allow users to play the game and set records. To do so, it manages the communications between the players and the Telegram API.
